This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This is common when using asynchronous operations like `useEffect` hooks that might not update the state immediately after the component mounts.  Consider this component:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('some-api-endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1> {/* Error: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name') */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

The `data.name` access attempts to read the `name` property before the `fetch` request completes and updates the `data` state.  This results in `data` being `null`, leading to the error.
